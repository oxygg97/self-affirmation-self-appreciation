1-greetings , my name is ala ben cheikh boubaker born in 6 november 1997, an ex-electrician and  a passionate
 and ambitious person about the IT lately since i joined the gomycode program which i'm pretty satsified 
so far except few things that should be improved for the platform.

2- i choose it simply because i want it to explore my potential and give it a shoot 
since i spend alot of time on pc playing video game i wanted to invest that wasted time into something usefull,
through this bootcamp i've noticed that i'm enjoying the learning process and learning 
timeline is short which is impress for someone who doesn't have IT background.

3- my biggest succes i could say partly finding my path in this field since i was trying different things looking for something that could enjoy for as a life career
i'm not into the idea to work something i don't like.

4- my biggest failure , well i wouldn't call it failure but my biggest lesson is to try everything and look for something
that satisfy you in every aspect partly if not totally.

5- big fan of constructive critism as it's a factor to improve yourself , i always ask for feedback and critism from different perspectives so i can improve myself
and the things that i'm doing from experienced and skilled individuals.
